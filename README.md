# American Red Cross Database Project 

## Project Description
The American Red Cross is a non-profit organization that focuses on blood donation and disaster relief. This project focuses on designing and implementing a donor database for the American Red Cross to track donations efficiently. We created an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, defined constraints, and developed a relational schema. After creating our database, we implemented queries to analyze donor activity, allocation of funds, and branch contributions, and we translated this structure into an ORM implementation with SQLAlchemy.
